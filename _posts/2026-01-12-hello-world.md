Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

I'll be writing about things I find interesting — probably a mix of maths, programming, and whatever rabbit holes I fall into.

## Why start a blog?

Writing helps me think. And if something I write is useful to someone else, that's a nice bonus.

## What to expect

I'm not sure yet. That's part of the fun.
